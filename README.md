This repo contains my work following the Data Engineering Zoomcamp curriculum, adapted to AWS services instead of GCP. Itâ€™s a hands-on learning journey toward building data pipelines with modern tools.

## About the Dataset

This project uses the [NYC TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), which contains detailed information on taxi trips in New York City, including pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
